# Spotify Api Wrapper
Wrapper for spotify webapi to use for custom virtual assistant
## TODO

* [ ] add installation path to path

* [X] Create a readme

* [X] Get some rest

* [X] Create a SAMPLE.env

## Installation
```bash

git clone https://github.com/rbrtbrnschn/spotify-api-wrapper.git
cd spotify-api-wrapper
./install

```

## Usage
Usage is slightly impaired at the moment.
- files that start with _ are python wrapper.
- files without .sh extention are executables related to the spotify api.

<hr/>
Rename the sample.env to .env

``` mv SAMPLE.env .env ```

Replace the placeholder with your Spotify API Token.

> This project was conceived to 'A lot of songs, due to this being a spotify wrapper - I switched songs alot.'
